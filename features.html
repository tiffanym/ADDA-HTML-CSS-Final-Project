							<h3>The Fantastic!</h3>
							<p>Haha, yeah it's not really a class subject, but I never title this section as "My Favorite CLASS Subjects" so...</p>
							<p>But in all seriousness, I took this English class called "The Enchanted Imagination" and it was truly beautiful. Granted there a lot of interpretations based around sexuality in some form or another, but that also depends on what books are on the syllabus.</p>
							<p>We even read the Lord of the Rings by J.R. Tolkien and hot damn that man was a genius. There's so much going on beyond just the superficial storyline. I'd recommend to everyone, except I don't know if I should bother, since it's already so popular. ;)
								<br> It is a very long read though, so if you just want to rush through a book in a few hours, you might want to pick up a book that's less hefty.
								<br> But hey, if you do decide to take the time, great! You won't regret it!
								<br> And if you somehow are able to get through the whole LOTR series without being some amazing speed reader, then I give you props for dedication. <img src="images/thumbsUp.png" alt="thumbs up" width="10%">

							<h3>Music</h3>
							<p>Honestly, with the music classes I've taken so far, regardless of the workload, the teachers who've been teaching were always passionate about what they taught. Probably it's because it's such an active part of their lives, since so many of them sing or direct a choir or professionally play some instrument.</p>
							<p>It's also a joy to listen to just because even if you can't understand music, if you crank the volume up load enough you can FEEL it.</p>
							<p>And many people in the world at least know who Beethoven, Bach, and Brahms are, although there are many, MANY more wonderfully skilled musicians that are not as integrated into mainstream culture nowadays, at least for the young'uns. It might change in the future though, so who really knows?</p>

	                    <p>For obvious reasons, I'm interested in programming. This whole site was programmed with the HTML/CSS skills I've learned so far.</p>
	                    <p>I think programming is cool because with many of the languages, one can see the product immediately. It's also fun just creating the things we usually interact with in our daily lives like websites, apps, programs, etc.</p>
	                    <p>It's amazing how much we take for granted that other people learn so much about and are creative enough to create these new languages to disseminate content and provide everyone all over the world with a network of knowledge and communication.</p>

	                <div class="panel-body">
	                    <p>I mean, who doesn't like making cute little amigurumis (a.k.a., stuffed animals), pillows, and other neat little things! Plus if you make scarves, hats, shirts, gloves, socks, etc. either for youself or for someone else, there's some extra meaning to it because you spent the time and care to make it.</p>
	                    <p>I usually crochet while watching TV or listening to music, since some projects can take as little as an hour or up to a few days or even a week (assuming I don't have much to do).</p>
	                    <p>I think it's a great way to destress because you're focusing on finishing this one task. Plus, you have to make sure you don't miscount the stitches like I do all the time :P</p>
	                    <p>WARNING: If you don't position your body right, you can get back or shoulder pain. It happens to me when I'm working on a project for hours, but usually it goes away after a good night's rest.</p>
	                    <p>ALSO: Crocheting is NOT, I repeat NOT, the same as knitting. They're two different activities. I find crocheting easier to learn, but that's probably also because I didn't spend too much time trying to learn how to knit.</p>

	                    <p>I've been learning ASL at a school club. I love how it teaches you to be more expressive, because that's something many hearing people fail to do sometimes. When we talk, we rely on the person we're talking to to actually listen. I think learning ASL not only promotes increased eye contact but also allows us to better emote ourselves, especially in a world where everything is now held back and hidden, even from those we love most.</p>
	                    <p>If you see me, don't expect me to be able to perfectly sign back. As of now, I'm still pretty much a beginner. I also don't really know the different sign "slang" for different regions, but I'm hoping to learn if I get the chance.</p>
	                    <p>I recommend people to learn it! If there are no classes in local colleges or schools, there are usually some private institutions or ASL centers that offer their own classes at a reasonable price.</p>
